Java:
Performance-Speed: 
P. Faster Speed is crucial in enterprise-level application development. Since it’s a compiled language, Java is faster at executing code than Python. Python is an interpreted language which determines the type of data at runtime.
P Java is an excellent choice for programmers looking for increased speed combined with flexibility across platforms.
P: If your application needs fast processing or large amounts of data per unit time, then go with Java since its JVM offers better optimization for this purpose
P: Java is a statically typed and compiled language, and Python is a dynamically typed and interpreted language. This single difference makes Java faster at runtime and easier to debug.
P Java is better developed for building web applications. Python’s Flask library is still only able to build the basics to a Python-based UI but is great for creating a Python back-end with an API endpoint.
P: Multi-threading (OS level threads). Very good concurrency primitives. The java.util.concurrent package is a great for different types of abstractions like threadpools, atomic primitives, oncurrent hashmaps. Futures and CompleteableFutures provide library support for async functions (no syntactic sugar).
N. The garbage collection-based memory management affects the performance of the application.

Memory Consumption:
N- Higher memory consumption.
Binding: Static
Compiled/Interpreted: Compiled (More Robust)
Readability: Easy
Syntax: Verbose

Python:
P Python has excellent data processing libraries and good data visualization capabilities 
P Python is easier to use and easier to read.
N Multi-threading not advisable for compute intensive code due to Global Interpreter Lock. People have observed their programs becoming slower due to threads.
Performance-Speed - Slower 
	

Summary
•	AI/ML - Python
•	High Concurrency servers - Java
•	Command line tools - Python
•	Streaming data processing - Java (due to Kafka/Spark/Flink)
•	Web development - Java/Python
•	Cross platform GUI programs like IDEs - Java
